"Sukiyaki Beef is good. 

Spicy garlic pork cutlet is good. 

Prom belly katsu don is good! 

Thunder fries with mentai sauce sibei good!"
"One of my fav store for pork collar. However, today there are a few pieces of burnt meat üòì"
"Delicious food, prompt delivery and excellent service!! üíØüíØüíØ"
"Super valued for money. Super affordable but yet restaurant standard sukiyaki beef donüòç 

Have been returning weekly to satisfy my cravingsüòÅ

Yes, friendly staffs tooü§£"
"Definitely a surprise find at punggol. Really affordable Japanese food at a kpt.
People behind the counter were really nice and friendly.
Ordered a pork belly katsu Don, a katsu platter and an extra serving of rice with onsen egg. And its all less than $20. üòúüòú
Food is on point. Portions were big.
Surely coming back for more."
"This place is certainly not 5stars worthy 

Tried the Pork Katsu don & Beef don 

Both fell way below expectations 

Katsu was soggy & Beef was tough

Had it at Marine Parade outlet

Punggol outlet might be better"
Our 1st groupbuy with them . Communication is good and it arrived hot hot :) . Portion is quite generous as well . Do give them a try .
awesome ppl.awesome food üòÅ
"Good Jap food at affordable pricing.
Not to mention that their improved significantly on the waiting time."
Best best best jap hawker style food I ever had! üëçüëçüëçüëç
Pork Belly Katsu Don is very delicious and ingredients use were fresh. Recommended to my colleagues for their next lunch choice :)
Yummzzz! Unexpectedly good Don.... and love the chicken Karaage w/curry sauce!
food is fantastic.. fresh ingredient. yummyüòãüòã.. must try.!
"Fresh ingredients, authentic and special cuisines with a delicate personal touch.üòãüòãüòã"
"Picture doesn‚Äôt do the food justice but this is my fav don from the this place. The pork is spicy and super fragrant, super appetising and I would crave for it sometimes!!! Have tried their other dons including: salmon, chicken oyakodon and their katsu and all really rather worth for the price point. Salmon offered tomato salad which was good! The katsu might get abit soggy and no longer crispy so would not reco that if you are going to takeaway"
"Was at Marine parade and saw this stall selling Japanese don with a constant queue. So I decided to try their don. The person took my order and wrote on a slip on paper my order and order number. She gave me one slip and the other slip to the person preparing the food. The cashier would then shout the order number once the order is done. So I would advise those ordering to get seats near the stall so that you know when your food is ready.
I got their Teriyaki Beef Short Plate W/ Onsen Egg which consists of Beef Short Plate, Onions, Onsen Egg and Furikake.
So I think my dish did not come with onions? Either that or they minced the onions really fine. So on to the rice. The rice was not bad, drenched with the beef drippings which added flavour to the plain rice. Beef was tender and was coated with teriyaki sauce and topped with Furikake. For the Furikake I think it did not add much value to the entire dish and I mostly tasted togarashi (Japanese chili powder) from it. On to the Onsen egg. Was a little disappointed as the yolk already broke.
Overall it was a very average tasting bowl of beef and I felt that they could have given slightly more meat for the don or maybe add the Furikake on the rice instead of just the meat so that at least when people eat the rice itself there's some taste."
"The folks at @fukudonsg have got their mise en place and kitchen line down to a tee, enabling them to serve a steady stream of customers quickly. This doesn‚Äôt always work in their favour. While the beef was tender and unctuous, the onsen egg yolk was already overcooked. Nevertheless, spot on flavours, although as always, their rice bowls could definitely do with more sauce.
Taste: 3/5"
"A photo that doesn‚Äôt do the dish justice. That char on the pork and the perfectly cook rice that still has a good bite to it. Not to mention, the sauces all complemented the dish super well. Gem at Marine Parade Central Market Hawker! The guys at the stall were SUPER nice and friendly too."
"Oh my stars, look at that golden crust encasing each glistening piece of meat. A pity it was already soggy by the time i received it. I expected pork belly to be more fatty and tender, but this was lean if still tasty. The soft scrambled eggs with onion was perfectly cooked, howeverIi wish there were more of it or at least had some sauce to go along with the plentiful rice below.

"I'd be hard-pressed to find another place serving a salmon don of this quality at this price point and because of their budget friendly yet tasty donburis, the queue starts forming way before their shutters go up for lunch everyday at noon.
Each serving comes with 3 pieces of succulent, oily salmon coated in a tangy shoyu lemon glaze and a side of @fukudonsg Japanese tomato salad over a bed of al dente calrose rice. While the portion is small, every bite is flavour packed. If you want to get your hands on this, come before 1pm because it‚Äôs one of their bestsellers and they run out of it inevitably.
Taste: 3.5/5"
"Salad at a hawker stall and Japanese-style at that? Consider me sold. Chunks of fresh local tomatoes and Japanese cucumber dressed in a goma sauce are the primary components here. What makes it a little more special are the translucent strings of white onion which have been lightly pickled to take away the rawness, unexpected but welcome segments of sweet mandarin and a savoury sprinkling of furikake to finish. All these lend depth of flavour and texture to something that could have ended up as an afterthought.
Taste: 3/5"
"Wasn‚Äôt intending to settle dinner at Marine Parade Food Centre initially, but was pretty bummed for the fact that the spot I intended to dine at in the area had many items on the menu being unavailable ‚Äî and thus I found myself heading to the food centre and checking Fukudon out, which describes themselves as an Asian Fusion Donburi Specialist which I have been following on social media for quite a while.
Felt that the ‚ÄúAsian Fusion Donburi‚Äù branding was a bit of a far stretch given how the various Donburi being offered on the menu here (i.e. Chicken Breast Oyakodon, Shoyu Glaze Salmon Don, Sukiyaki Beef Short Plate Don with Onsen Eg etc.) all sound pretty Japanese-inspired ‚Äî that being said, we were more than impressed with the Pork Belly Katsu Don which we had opted for. While the fried pork belly seems to carry more bite and was less gelatinous and fatty than what we had initially expected especially given the illustrations on the menu, the element that sealed the deal for us was the runny egg which is simmered in dashi broth alongside onions ‚Äî incredibly runny and silky, the eggs also carried a punchy savoury note that provides so much flavour to the entire dish, with the sauce even permeating the bed of short-grain rice below that gives the otherwise plain rice some moisture and a sweet-savoury note. Japanese spicy powder has also been sprinkled over the top to provide the Donburi with a slight hint of spiciness ‚Äî just enough to tickle the tastebuds without overwhelming the entire dish.
Given what we had tried at Fukudon, we were left pretty impressed with what they have to offer ‚Äî the execution of the eggs here were particularly noteworthy, and is pretty much an important element that makes up a good Oyakodon and Katsudon. While it‚Äôs offerings seem to be rather Japanese at heart, they do seem to have places quite a bit of effort in trying to serve up quality food for the masses at pocket-friendly prices. Quite interested in their Thunder Crunchy Fries which comes either with Homemade Curry Sauce or Mentaiko Sauce ‚Äî something which I am pretty keen to try on my subsequent visit here."
"Saw this new stall in Marine Parade Food Centre operating by bunch of young people, serving donburi in this food court.
Although they just opened very recently but they have attracted long queue during peak hours.
Go for their signature pork belly katsu don, topped with slices of thick, crispy and juicy pork katsu; simmered together with egg, onion and Japanese rice.
The portion wasn‚Äôt big but sufficient for me. $6.60"
"very impressive, well marinated and tender!!"

"I have always respected the younger generation to venture into the hawker industry. But definitely not for this particular hawker. With such an attitude, I will never patronise this shop anymore"
"Food was kinda disappointing compared to the good reviews written online. Not very value in terms of taste for the price... I wont be queuing again.

The issue is the service staff who has a poor attitude when taking customers order/requests and does not seem trained when it comes to food handling. On multiple occasions saw this staff scratching her hair then handling customer's food and not wearing mask properly."
"The chicken was cold..... new establishment so that's ok, theres always room for improvements.

1/5. Mainly for the poor attitude and rude girl taking order. When told the food is cold, she just stares at u. Terrible especially when some of us work in the service industry. She could have nicely communicated but chose to act snobbish.

Would have given 2 stars for the food, 0 star for the person taking order. Thus 1 star rating."
"Could have given 0 if possible

Extremely disappointed with the Pork Belly Katsu Don & Beef Don

Both dishes fell way below expectations and do not expect your food to look
even similar to what was shown on the menu

Katsu was soggy, Beef was tough

Will not visit again

Pricing wise @ S$6.90 you can tastier food than this at Marine Parade Hawker Centre with spare change"
Very Good Place
Not good at all.
"Have always wanted to try this but only open at noon. (So has severely limited my ability to eat this earlier cos I prefer to eat lunch before 12noon)
tried the spicy pork collar ó
Did not look as nice as the photos.  It was incredibly yellowÖ. Curry powder as the primary ingredient in the pork? I would have expected it to be drizzled in spice powdersÖ..  if I knew it was curry powder I would not have ordered this!!!

The meat dishes were fried on the spotÖ. And the pork shreds were not properly separated and ended up stuck together, clumped together, I was worried it be uncooked in between.

The so called onsen egg was only ë50%í there. Had a video but could not put it up.  Only a little egg yolk oozed out, the rest were semi hard.

Semi generous in the spring onions but wish they gave a bit more (even tho I asked for more); or to have a bit more garnishing.  Since it fusion, how about fried garlic chips/crumbs or even shallots.

Unlikely I will go back to try their other dishes."
"Was recommended by my family to come and try. First of all, I am always skeptical when I see sprinkles of furikake and powders on top of the bowl, because the Japanese themselves rarely do that as it mostly skews the taste of the meat and rice. Portion is decent. But the worst of all was the rice. Never seen such a bad rice before. Don't even talk about it being Japanese rice or not, it's dry and brittle as hell. Felt like overnight rice or something. Tried to be understanding, but man it was super disappointing."
"Didnít enjoy the food. Too egg was too sweet, and the pork katsu very flat. Waste of calories"
Nothing special. Ordered beef short plate. Slight tough to chew. Not a good value when you are served with a bowl full of rice with little meats. Was hoping the quality would outweigh the quantity. Both seems lacking. These young lads are very hardworking though.
"Not bad. Interesting new generation food. Queue is pretty long but not worth the wait as the portion is small and nothing special... for the size, the price is on the high side."
"New stall at this hawker centre. Had the chicken karaage with curry sauce and rice for $4.50 - impressed by the huge portion for such a price. I left the place feeling extremely full. The chicken was served piping hot, and the thigh meat was well marinated, very tender, and layered with a well seasoned, crisp and light batter.

The curry sauce was interesting as I expected it to be Japanese curry but it seemed like a rendition of McDonaldís curry sauce (but a more pineapple-y version of it).

The additional side of potato salad though, was extremely disappointing which contributed to the reduction in stars for this review. While the serving size was also larger than what I had expected, this seemed more like an onion salad. There was a disproportionately large amount of almost-raw, crunchy onions in the salad which ruined the entire dish.

Overall some hits and misses - would rate it 3.5 stars. Worth giving them a chance if youíre in the area."
"Always wanted to try this stall at Marine Parade hawker center, but they are always closed. Little did I realise their operating hours is 12-3pm only and 6pm till sold out? And they are closed on Monday. Itís quite complicating. Anyway, on to the food. Ordered the Spicy garlic pork collar Don w/ onsen egg ($6.60) and the Homemade chicken karaage w/ curry sauce ($4.50)

The spicy garlic pork collar Don was so-so. For the amount and price, it was slightly pricey. The Karaage with curry sauce on the other hand was really nice. Light, crispy, chicken tender inside. Goes well with the curry sauce although the curry sauce tastes like from McDonaldís. Overall, decent food, slightly high prices."
"The rice looks like it's short-grain but tastes just like the rice you get from an average cai fan stall. The sukiyaki beef don was okay in terms of price-to-meat ratio, and the beef strips were pretty tender. Onsen egg texture was also on point. But unfortunately, I really hated the rice quality so I wouldn't be back. The Spicy Marinated Pork Collar wasn't great for us too. The so-called pork collar is actually made with minced pork and didn't have the flavour or texture we were expecting. Given the price point, these are forgiveable but there's also nothing to draw me back, unless I can just dabao onsen eggs a la carte."
"Got the sukiyaki Beef Don with egg. It stated that there's onions but somehow I don't think I ate or tasted any?

The rice was not bad, drenched with the beef drippings which added some flavour to the plain rice.
Furikake was placed on top of the meat only and didn't really add much value to the dish. Tasted more of the togarashi powder which is the Japanese chili powder.
Beef was tender but they could have been more generous with the amount given. The teriyaki sauce was okay, tasted like how it should be.
For my onsen egg, was a little disappointed as the yolk already broke.

Overall an average tasting don with a constant queue of customer."
It was a nice bowl of katsudon. I felt it was bit on the salty side and it wasnít anything special. Price was reasonable given the small portion but was it worth the 30 mins wait? Maybe not. I may be tempted if the queue was shorter.
"Hits and misses for me, some good, some not. First time I tried the short beef, was impressed. Now trying the pork coller, its below average so i hv to go for a 3-star"
Thought that it was way too salty. Was really quite average taste-wise. Seems overpriced to me at $6.60.
ok..
Very decent and delicious donburi .. finally had the chance to try it as itís not always opened when Iím in the area. Managed to buy and try different dons. All four are pretty good.
Pretty good donburi for a very cheap price. Rice doesn't taste all that Japanese unfortunately.
"Humble stall at a hawker centre not far from ECP - good effort run by some youngsters & food is not bad.

Iíll visit again if Iím in the area, just wonít queue for it if the line is long.

Happy to support young entrepreneurs."
Ordered the Pork Belly Katsu Don. Good texture and taste but could do with a complimentary Miso Soup.
"Try the pork belly katsu don, itís soft and tender. The fries are also crispy and potatoey, great with the curry sauce!"
The sukiyaki beef don is my go-to order at Fukudon! Very tasty and affordable!
"There was already a long queue when I arrived before the store opened. The queue started before the stall opened at 12, so do be prepared to wait. We ordered the Short Plate Beef Bowl, Tonkatsu Bowl, Katsu Platter and Thunder Crunchy fries to share among 3 pax. The Katsu Platter and Tonkatsu Bowl were nicely executed for deep fried items - though we felt that we had slightly too much fried stuff towards the end. The beef bowl was much lighter and went well with the onsen egg. The rice in both bowls were a bit ""heavy"". The Thunder Crunchy Fries live up to their name in crispness, and comes with a nice (though not unique) dip."
Karaage here is super sexy ???? freshly fried and crispy. All the donburi are really good and affordable. Will definitely come here again for comfort food
"Located at Marine Parade hawker, this stall specializes in dons.

We has the sukiyaki don and the katsu don. Both were very good and the soft boiled eggs were perfectly cooked. Flavours were on point, wasn't expecting this from a hawker stall. ??

The food is very reasonably priced too.

Expect a queue if you are going during peak hours and this place only accepts cash."

"Have been patronising this stall for a few months with my friends. The food is always of standard, and itís definitely worth it for the price. The portion is good! For a dollar more, you can have a double portion of chicken! (Good for you people trying to clock in your protein)

Ps. Iíve read through the other reviews. & I think if youíve too, please give it a try on your own. Cause IMO, itís definitely worth it. Kudos to the chef!!

Staff service maybe slightly improved. But overall, the food makes me a happy girl."
"I went to order pork katsudon today, there was a long queue. I placed my order, then went back to my table. When I went to pick up my order, I saw it was already in a plastic bag. I rushed  to collect my order and went back home. Then I realized at home there were two packages instead of just one, it turned out I took the wrong order and it was someone elseís.

My two daughters liked the beef and salmon order that I accidentally took. I tried to contact them through WhatsApp, and the response was very fast, they understood and asked me to come back and return the food or to keep on the house. We are very happy with the order and the service!"
Had a takeaway pork belly don with added beef. Taste and texture was good and the portion was more than enough. Price was fair for the quality and portion. Will recommend whoever is in the area to try the store. Would come back to try dining in at the hawker as I can only imagine how fantastic the food would be eating it fresh out of the kitchen!
"FOOD IS AWESOME. Chef Remus even provided delivery personally.

Chicken Katsu and Mentaiko is a must try!!!"
"Love their Salmon Don (and I always request to add egg!). Comes with generous portion of tomato and oranges. (Sounds weird combo, but is very very very delicious!).
Their Salmon is a must try!"
This place is a hidden gem. Fantastic dons at very reasonable prices. Great value for money! Will be back again soon.
"Ordered in for reservist, food received as packed well and still tasted delicious. Free delivery for orders above $50, minimum order amount starts from $20 ($10 delivery fee islandwide).

Menu is very diverse, will definitely have something for everyone. Ordered their blackboard menu special, which was satay pork collar with achar and egg floss. Pork was very tasty and tender!!! Will definitely come back.

Heard they are opening an outlet in Punggol soon and canít wait to have Fukudon in my hoodÖ"
"Generous servings, super tasty pork belly and beef! price is reasonable with friendly young hawkers! will come back again"
"My familyís latest favorite Donburi place. Restaurant standard, hawker center price."
Awesome food and affordable! Highly recommended!
"Tasty again, got pork belly donburi and karaage this time. Worth the wait,  and love that it's so close to home."
The Pork Belly Don... Iíve tasted more expensive ones that arenít as good. If youíre talking value this is it right here. Nom nom nom.
"Great food at even better prices. Tastes superb with huge portions, happy to support the team of young hawkers."
"Nice & delicious and also very affordable price.
Definitely Will go back to eat again. ????"
"Ordered the Karage  with homemade curry. The Karage tasted really good, super crispy on the outside  and moist on the inside and the curry went well okay with the rice. Topped up 50cents for rice so my meal costed about $5. Will come back again next time :)"
Love the spicy pork collar don. Restaurant quality at food court price. ??
Friendly proprietors and the food is decent. One of the best potato salads I've tried
Really good food. Clean and healthy. Love the potato salad. Must try
Food is good. Fair share of portion. Highly Recommended
Awesome food and price is highly affordable for the masses. Will surely return for more.
"Food is fantastic and tasty
Definitely wonít be a disappointment

Overalls 10/10??????"
Fukudonís food is really good and is super value for its money!
Cheap price but the taste is nice
"Good food. Very tasty. For Japanese food, I think the price is really worth for what you get"
The food is nice and not costly. ??
"New Asian fuision eating place that sell donburi.
Made with love and passion by chef Remus, bringing nostalgic deep flavours to bring happiness to those who eats.
Will update for more detail."
Food is nice and affordable!
Fantastic food at a very competitive price.
Value and quality.
Inspiring success
Ordered chicken Oyakodon and the Sukiyaki beef short plate for the first time. Generous portion and itís delicious and affordable. A gem hidden in the heartlands.
"Ordered Pork Belly Katsu Don. For $7 a bowl, nothing to complain. Will try their other don another time."
"Dishes served were delightful to the taste buds! Thereís an impressive variety of menu items, making this the perfect venue to curb all my Japanese cravings at once ????"
"Very fresh salad and super tasty wagyo onigiri don, must try."
"Generous portion and cheap!! Food is delicious. I tried the karrage and the meat is very tender and melts in the mouth. The tomato salad in this Shoyu Glazed Salmon Don is unique, has orange pieces in it which adds an interesting taste."
"Food was good, service staff were friendly and nice! definitely recommending to my friends"
Chanced upon this restaurant at Punggol !   Love the crispy outer and juicy inner of their chicken karrage.  Fries was well done too.   Definitely returning to try their Don!
"Ordered for company gathering, food came hot and fresh, not to mention the super tasty food, and came on time, they only take phone call order for now but itís island wide free delivery above 80$ so itís really worth it!!!!!!!!
Canít wait to order again for the next gathering!!!"
Pork Don n chucky fries 1 of the nicer Don n fries I had. Highly recommended.
Good food and better than previous stall.
Food prices are affordable!

The guys at the stall were SUPER nice and friendly too
